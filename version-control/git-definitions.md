# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way for you and others to keep track of changes made to code. It's useful because it allows people to look back at a history of changes to help solve problems going forward.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of your work a.k.a. project. It's useful if you want to experiment with different things in your project without messing up the origin points of where you started playing with experiments.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for your project that should contain a commit message. A good commit message states what you changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of the same file and merged them together.
