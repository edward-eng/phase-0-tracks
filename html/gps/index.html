<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Tells the browser how to display the information. A lot of tags seems useful. I guess it just depends on what kind of website you're building.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
I guess top to bottom?
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Snippets seem like they can be pretty useful, especially if you want to add many instances of one thing like a large table.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
It was all pretty straightforward. Most of the stuff you can look up online if you need help or discuss with someone. The most difficult thing is probably just working with other people in a team which is why DBC highly emphasizes GPSs and learning good pairing practices. -->
