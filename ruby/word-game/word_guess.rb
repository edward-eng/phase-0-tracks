# Pseudocode - secret word guessing game

# The game will start out by greeting the players.
# Then the game will ask player 1 for a secret word.
# Itâ€™ll store the secret word.

# Then the game will show player 2 a hidden word.
# The hidden word will contain underscores each representing a letter of the secret word.

# Then the game will tell player 2 how many guesses he or she has to win the game.
# The number of guesses is equal to twice the length of the secret word.
# Then the game will ask player 2 for a letter.
# The game will store this letter.

# Then the game will check to see if the letter is in the secret word.
	# If the letter is in the word, replace the corresponding underscores with the letter.
# The game will show player 2 an updated version of the hidden word.

# The game will show player 2 the letters that he or she has guessed so far.
# Then the game will show player 2 the latest version of the hidden word.
# Then the game will show player 2 how many guesses he or she has left.
# Then the game will ask player 2 for another letter.
# The game will store this letter.
# The game will check to see if this letter has been guessed before.
	# If player 2 entered a letter he or she has guessed before, prompt the player to enter another letter. Then store that letter. The game will check to see if the letter is in the secret word.
		# If the letter is in the secret word, replace the corresponding underscores in the hidden word.
		# The game will show player 2 an updated version of the hidden word.

# Repeat this process until there are no more letters to guess or if player 2 runs out of guesses
	# If there are no more letters to guess, tell player 2 he or she won.
	# If player 2 runs out of guesses, tell him or her she lost.

# Exit the game
