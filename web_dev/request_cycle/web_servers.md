### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a virtual machine (VM). It runs its own copy of an operating system like Linux for example. A VPS can have multiple users with one of them being a 'super' user that has the ability to install software on the operating system.

Advantages of Using a VPS

-The cost is a lot less than an actual dedicated server.
-It's not affected by any other segregated server's activity or customization.
-Its performance is a bit higher than a shared server.
-It's relatively secure since it has its own operating system and resources which makes it difficult for other servers to invade.

One of the biggest reasons why it's bad is because of security reasons. You can easily edit or delete files. Your system is also more vulnerable to destructive viruses.
