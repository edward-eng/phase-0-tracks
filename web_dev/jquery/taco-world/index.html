		<p>We use the freshest local ingredients. Many of them are organic. We also make our own taco shells and tortillas in house.</p>
	<h2 id="history">A Bit of Taco World History</h2>
		<p>We got started in 1949 as a small mom-and-pop shop in Los Angeles, California. And now we have 14 locations across the United States. The cool thing is that each shop still has its own mom-and-pop feel to it, so we haven't forgetten our roots. We hope you enjoy our tacos as much as we do!</p>
